PASSAGE I

Read the passage carefully and answer each question that follows.
 
Governance is a concept encompassing all aspects of the exercise of 
authority through formal and informal institutions in the management of 
the resources of a state.  The quality of governance is thus determined by 
the impact of this exercise of power on the quality of life enjoyed by 
citizens.  There is a growing awareness in the community that an 
enabling environment is needed to impact on the well-being of its 
citizens, such enabling environment are created by interest, institutions 
and policies. Although no single index can conceptually capture all 
aspects of this enabling environment, a focus on key observable aspects 
of the governance dimensions can be helpful. The key observable 
aspects of the governance dimension considered are citizen’s voice, 
government orientation, social development, and economic 
management. The ability to create an index of governance quality has 
been enhanced by the creation of several indexes in recent years.  For 
example, we make use of previously published indexes measuring health 
provision, education, quality political freedom, and government 
corruption.
