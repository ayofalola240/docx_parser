Dolphins are regarded as the friendliest creatures in the sea and stories of them helping drowning sailors have been common since Roman times.  The more we learn about dolphins, the more we realize that their society is more complex than people previously imagined. They look after other dolphins when they are ill, care for pregnant mothers and protect the weakest in the community, as we do.         Some scientists have suggested that dolphins have a language but it is much more probable that they communicate with each other without needing words.  Could any of these mammals be more intelligent than man?  Certainly, the most common argument in favour of man�s superiority over them that we can kill them more easily than they can kill us is the least satisfactory.  On the contrary, the more we discover about these remarkable creatures, the less we appear superior when we destroy them.",

Instead of maximizing wealth, effort should be directed towards the creation of reasonable standard of living for all people. This applies to the rich and the poor. Nations which are already wealthy have to accept that they are members of the world�s resources but no more. They should not expect to continue to deal with problem of comparative poverty within their own nation at the expense of people abroad who are poorer than their poorest. And the poor nations have to face facts too. They need to stop trying to ape the rich. They have to accept that the closing the gap does not mean and cannot mean attaining for themselves a western style or level of consumption.Adapted from Otuikpe, B.
